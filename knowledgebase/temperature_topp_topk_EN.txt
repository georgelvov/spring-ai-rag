Temperature
///////////////////////

🔹 Low temperature (close to 0, e.g., 0.2)
The neural network becomes very cautious and predictable. It will choose only the most probable next words.
Responses are clear and to the point but can be boring, repetitive, and lacking originality.

Analogy: "strict instruction" mode.
Suitable for: factual summaries, writing code according to precise specifications.

🔹 High temperature (e.g., 0.9)
The neural network becomes "bolder." It starts considering less likely, more unexpected words.
Responses become creative, diverse, sometimes even witty.
But there is a risk: the text can become incoherent, contain made-up facts, or just nonsense.

Analogy: "brainstorming" mode.
Suitable for: idea generation, creative writing, exploring unusual phrasings.

///////////////////////
Top-P (Nucleus Sampling) — selection limiter
///////////////////////

Temperature controls how much the model likes to take risks (choosing less predictable words),
while Top-P controls how wide the pool of words is that the model considers before making a choice.
In other words, this parameter often goes hand-in-hand with temperature and offers another way to control output.
Instead of changing the probabilities of all words (like temperature), Top-P limits the set of words the model can
choose from. Top-P is often used as an alternative to high temperature to get creative but more coherent responses.

How it works:
For example, after the phrase: "Today outside is very..."

Possible continuations and their probabilities might be:

Word	Probability
hot	        0.4
cold	    0.3
beautiful	0.1
rainy	    0.05
cheerful	0.05
noisy	    0.05
boring	    0.05

🔹 If topP = 0.1
Start from the top, the most probable word:
hot → 0.4 (already exceeds 0.1).
Stop!
We reached "word probability >= topP."
Only one word — "hot" — is included in the pool.

🔹 If topP = 0.9
We take the most probable words from the top until their cumulative probability reaches 0.9. Step by step:
"hot" → 0.4 → cumulative 0.4
"cold" → 0.3 → cumulative 0.7
"beautiful" → 0.1 → cumulative 0.8
"rainy" → 0.05 → cumulative 0.85
"cheerful" → 0.05 → cumulative 0.9 ✅
Total probability = 0.9, the remaining words are excluded.

🔹 How the LLM selects
The LLM randomly selects a word from this pool, with probability proportional to the original word probability.
So "hot" is chosen more often than "rainy" or "cheerful," because it has 0.4 vs. 0.05.

///////////////////////
Top-K
///////////////////////

🔹 What is top-K
Top-K limits the model’s choice to a fixed number of words instead of a probability sum.
We tell the model:
"Look only at the topK most probable words and randomly pick one."
All other words are completely ignored, even if they have high probability.

🔹 Example
Word	Probability
hot     	0.4
cold	    0.3
beautiful	0.1
rainy	    0.05
cheerful	0.05
noisy	    0.05
boring	    0.05

If topK = 3, we take the three most probable words:
"hot," "cold," "beautiful."
The model randomly selects one of these three, proportional to their original chances.
Words "rainy," "cheerful," "noisy," "boring" are completely excluded.

///////////////////////
Repeat Penalty
///////////////////////

RepeatPenalty is a parameter that helps LLMs avoid repeating the same word or phrase over and over.

🔹 Simple explanation
LLMs sometimes repeat the same words or expressions when generating text.
RepeatPenalty is a way to "penalize" the model for repetition.
The higher the value, the more the model avoids repeats.

🔹 How it works in practice
The model picks the next word.
If that word has already appeared in the text, its probability is divided by repeatPenalty.
For example:
repeatPenalty = 1.2 → probability slightly reduced
repeatPenalty = 2.0 → probability halved
The model can still choose the word, but less often than new words.

🔹 Example
Text:
"Today outside is hot, and hot is very pleasant."
Without repeatPenalty, the model might continue: "hot, hot, hot…"
With repeatPenalty = 1.5, the probability of "hot" is reduced after the first occurrence → the model
chooses more diverse words like "sunny" or "warm."

🔹 Summary
repeatPenalty = 1.0 → no penalty, repeats allowed
repeatPenalty > 1.0 → repeats are less likely
Helps make text more natural and varied
